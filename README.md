# MSU Majors
 
If you are familiar with Michigan State University, then you'll know that navigating the various different websites can be a pain and it's not very user-friendly. All the information on the different academic programs is spread out and some programs lack information completely. This website aims to fix that issue and provide a place where incoming and even current students can browse and read up on all the different majors that MSU has to offer and find which one is the best fit for them. View possible careers and the career progression that would follow, along with salary information, the best states to work in, and much more!
